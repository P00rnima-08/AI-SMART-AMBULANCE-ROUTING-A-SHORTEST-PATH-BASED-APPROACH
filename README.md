# AI-SMART-AMBULANCE-ROUTING-A-SHORTEST-PATH-BASED-APPROACH

AI Smart Ambulance Routing is an advanced system designed to optimize emergency response times by dynamically determining the shortest and fastest route for ambulances. Traffic congestion often delays critical medical assistance, leading to life-threatening situations. This system leverages AI-powered pathfinding algorithms, real-time traffic data, and GPS integration to ensure ambulances reach their destinations as quickly as possible. By analyzing live traffic conditions and roadblocks, the system identifies the most efficient route, reducing delays and improving patient survival rates.

The project utilizes graph-based shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and A Search*, combined with machine learning models that predict traffic patterns. Additionally, integration with IoT-enabled smart traffic signals can facilitate green corridor creation for ambulances, giving them priority passage. This AI-driven approach enhances emergency medical services (EMS) efficiency and can be deployed in urban smart city infrastructures to revolutionize healthcare accessibility during emergencies.
